# music-scripts
my python scripts for downloading, encoding and checking music

what it does:
- downloads a youtube playlist
- extracts the encoded files with *ffmpeg*
- checks the file for quality (bitrate + **epic cutoff frequency analyzer**)
- then encodes it with *fdkaac* and renames it


i used some code from:
